# Collection-Efficiency-of-PV-Solar-Cells

This Python script calculates how efficiently Silicon, a common material used in solar cells, can collect energy from a high-temperature light source like the Sun. It does this by estimating the maximum fraction of sunlight that can be absorbed and converted into electricity, based on Silicon’s bandgap energy—the minimum energy needed to free an electron and generate current.

The script uses basic physics constants, including the bandgap energy of Silicon and the temperature of the light source, to compute a threshold value. It then performs two integrations: one to count the number of photons with enough energy to be useful, and another to measure the total energy available. By comparing these two, it calculates the theoretical maximum efficiency for collecting energy.

This kind of analysis is useful in designing solar cells, selecting materials for photovoltaic applications, and understanding the limits of energy conversion from sunlight.

The collection efficiency, $$\eta_{collection}^{max} = x_{gap} \frac{\int_{x_{gap}}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x-1} dx}{\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^3}{e^x-1} dx}$$

**Steps in the Script** 

E_gap = 1.1 eV: Bandgap energy of Silicon.\
k_B = 8.617e-5 eV/K: Boltzmann constant.\
T = 6000 K: Temperature of the blackbody source (e.g., the Sun).

Calculate Dimensionless Quantity x_gap: $$x_{gap}= \frac{E_{gap}}{k_BT}$$. This represents the normalized energy threshold for photon absorption.

$$x_{gap}$$ is a specific threshold value of the variable $$x$$ that corresponds to the bandgap energy of the material. It marks the minimum normalized energy a photon must have to be absorbed by the material and contribute to electricity generation.
